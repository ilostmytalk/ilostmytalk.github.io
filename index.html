        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever thought about what it means to lose something as personal as your own voice? When I first read Rita Joe’s poem “I Lost My Talk,” it struck me that “talk” doesn't just refer to a literal ability to speak, but rather to one's "voice", and its distinct tone—shaped by the cultures, experiences and opinions it gives vocalization to. And having that freedom, that security in one's identity being challenged and taken away is bound to only lead to confusion, and a trauma that cuts right to their core. The experiences Joe outlines through the speaker echoes these ideas, and give a face to the voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The poem begins with an almost stark declaration of loss: “I lost my talk / The talk you took away.” Just eight words in, there’s a haunting clarity. Instead of a drawn-out lament, we get a blunt truth. Immediately, Joe sets the tone of deprivation. But the more I read, the more I realized that her words also reveal a dogged refusal to disappear. Yes, someone else might have “taken” her talk, but she still stands here telling us about it. There’s a quiet fight underneath the pain—a fight that leads us toward the poem’s deeper meaning: the speaker’s struggle to reclaim not just a voice, but an entire cultural identity.

      <!-- ANALYSIS SECTION -->
      <section id="analysis" class="section-block">
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Everything in the poem, from its short, deliberate lines to its careful repetition, works together to show how cultural and linguistic identity can be shaped—or twisted—by external forces. Joe uses lines like “I speak like you / I think like you / I create like you.” And at first glance, to me these words just seemed like an admission of defeat. But as I kept reading, I noticed how they actually reflect the other side back onto itself. In highlighting how the speaker can “perform” in this forced way, Joe reveals exactly what’s been stolen. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This is how the poem builds its meaning: through the contrast between a quiet, almost resigned tone and a stark awareness of what has been lost. That tension climaxes in the longing to regain the speaker’s own way of thinking and creating, emphasized by those repeated “like you” lines. There’s a jarring sadness in her having to conform, which the poem transforms into a call for restoration. By the end, we see a clear desire to reclaim something fundamental—her culture and voice—making the text a testament to resilience as much as it is an acknowledgment of grief.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this piece is rooted in the historical experiences of Indigenous peoples—particularly those forced into residential schools—the heartbreak and yearning for self-reclamation feel universal. Anyone who has ever been pressured to hide or alter a fundamental part of themselves can identify with Joe’s emotional landscape. The imagery of having language “snatched away” might bring to mind different forms of cultural assimilation: immigrants losing their mother tongue, or individuals whose accents or dialects are mocked into oblivion. There’s both a timeless and urgent quality to this message, reminding us that these struggles aren’t relics of the past.

      <!-- RELEVANCE SECTION -->
      <section id="relevance" class="section-block">
        <h2>Relevance & Timelessness</h2>
        <p>
          What truly sets “I Lost My Talk” apart is its choice to lead with gentleness rather than fury. Personally, I expected a more confrontational tone—but what I found was a poem that starts in a place of grief and gradually transforms that grief into a kind of trembling hope. It culminates with the speaker’s request: “Let me find my talk.” And to me, these words did not seem as much an outcry for revenge as a plea for restoration and unity. It’s this quiet urgency that makes the poem resonate far beyond its historical context, marking it as both relatable and timeless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joe never demands condemnation or retribution; instead, she insists on the speaker’s humanity. That’s a crucial reminder that to rebuild something stolen—especially language and identity—can be more impactful than sheer anger. The poem invites us to empathize, to see the dignity of someone who’s been silenced, and to question why any culture would want to erase such a vital voice. In a world where conflicts over language, heritage, and belonging persist, the poem’s message continues to ring true: losing your “talk” isn’t just about losing words, but losing a piece of who you are.

      <!-- CONCLUSION SECTION -->
      <section id="conclusion" class="section-block">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In the end, “I Lost My Talk” is a reminder that what’s lost can, at least in part, be reclaimed. Whether we’re looking at the legacy of residential schools or everyday erasures of culture, Joe’s poem shows how deeply assimilation can cut—and how powerful it is to confront that pain, no matter how quietly. That’s why her message remains as relevant today as ever: we all have a right to speak in our own voice, and that voice deserves both recognition and respect. The poem also reflects on how, while it is important to remember and reflect on the wrongdoings of the past, it is also important to be able to let go of any grudges for the sake of striving for a better future.
        </p>
        <p>
          By demonstrating how Rita Joe threads together personal testimony with a call for self-recovery and peace, “I Lost My Talk” leaves us with a compelling truth, that even when everything else is taken, we can still rediscover our stories, reclaim our words, and stand firm in our sense of self. It's a timeless invitation to honor our heritage and carry it forward—speaking as loudly, or as softly, as we need to.

        <td><strong>What can you learn from the title of the poem?</strong></td>
        <td>
          The title <em>“I, Too”</em> signals a desire for unity and visibility. By isolating “I,” the poem stresses 
          the speaker’s belonging in a context that tries to exclude him. The comma further emphasizes that 
          “I, too” should be included among those who matter.
        </td>
        <td>
          The title <em>“I Lost My Talk”</em> hints at a metaphor for losing one’s sense of identity. The word 
          “lost” sets a somber tone, suggesting a deep grief over a taken or silenced cultural expression. 
          This underscores how essential “talk” (or voice) is to the poem’s theme.

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Assonance/Consonance:</strong> “company comes,” “And grow strong” create a subtle 
              harmony and add a rhythmic emphasis.</li>
            <li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> “company comes” is a neat alliterative moment that helps unify 
              the line.</li>
            <li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The poem’s entire setting (the “kitchen”) is a metaphor for forced 
              segregation. “Darker brother” stands for African Americans collectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Anaphora:</strong> Phrases like “And eat well, / And grow strong” show repeated “And” 
              at line openings, amplifying the speaker’s resilience.</li>

        </td>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Assonance:</strong> Heard in “ways I say, / Your way,” or “hand and,” giving lines a 
              gentle echo.</li>
            <li><strong>Alliteration:</strong> “The talk you took away,” “The scrambled ballad” highlight 
              repetition of consonants.</li>
            <li><strong>Metaphor:</strong> “Talk” represents the poet’s cultural identity. “Snatching” it 
              reflects ethnic cleansing or forced assimilation.</li>
            <li><strong>Repetition – Epistrophe:</strong> “I speak like you / I think like you / I create 
              like you.” The recurring “like you” underscores the speaker’s imposed mimicry.</li>
            <li><strong>Simile:</strong> “I speak like you…” uses “like” to compare the speaker’s forced 
              speech to the oppressor’s.</li>

          <strong>How are the words arranged? What is the effect on the reader?</strong>
        </td>
        <td>
          Hughes arranges short, direct lines that shift from a subdued tone (“They send me…”) to a 
          confident, forward-looking stance (“Tomorrow, / I’ll be at the table”). The structure intensifies 
          the journey from marginalization to empowerment, so readers feel both the speaker’s frustration 
          and determination.
        </td>
        <td>
          Rita Joe uses spare, blunt lines—“I lost my talk / The talk you took away”—that land like honest 
          confessions. The brevity forces the reader to confront a stark loss head-on. It evokes immediate 
          empathy for the speaker’s situation, emphasizing the starkness of cultural erasure.

        </td>
        <td>
          Clusters like “They,” “send,” “kitchen,” “laugh,” and “grow strong” revolve around oppression, 
          defiance, and eventual triumph. These words drive home the poem’s main idea: the speaker refuses 
          to be relegated to an inferior space or identity.
        </td>
        <td>
          “Lost,” “talk,” “took away,” “snatched,” “let me find” convey forced integration and the speaker’s 
          longing to reclaim what was taken. They point to a main theme of cultural dispossession and a 
          struggle for self-restoration.

          2) How does the title relate to the theme?
        </td>
        <td>
          <strong>Theme/Main Idea:</strong> Showcasing ongoing racial discrimination and voicing a sense of 
          resilience. The poem depicts a social hierarchy where the speaker is unfairly cast aside, yet he 
          declares he “too” is part of America.<br><br>
          <strong>Title &amp; Theme Connection:</strong> “I, Too” directly ties into the speaker’s assertion 
          that he belongs, challenging racial exclusion.
        </td>
        <td>
          <strong>Theme/Main Idea:</strong> Shining a light on an Indigenous speaker’s experience, likely in 
          a residential school, and her desire to reclaim identity.<br><br>
          <strong>Title &amp; Theme Connection:</strong> “I Lost My Talk” underlines that the poem revolves 
          around a stolen cultural voice—and her hope to find it again.

        <td>
          <strong>Standout Line:</strong> “But I laugh,” because it captures a quick spark of resilience in 
          a hostile setting.<br><br>
          <strong>Question:</strong> “How did you (or the speaker) discover beauty and strength in a world 
          telling you otherwise?” I’d ask this to understand the process of finding self-worth amid 
          constant discrimination.
        </td>
        <td>
          <strong>Standout Line:</strong> “Your way is more powerful.” It strikes me as either forced 
          acknowledgment or an attempt to appease. It feels heartbreaking that she must admit this at all.<br><br>
          <strong>Question:</strong> “Why aren’t you/the speaker angry?” Given the trauma, I’d expect 
          bitterness. Instead, the speaker forgives and extends empathy, which I find both admirable 
          and intriguing.

          Do you notice any other part of the poet’s intersectionality? Explain.</strong>
        </td>
        <td>
          Hughes uses terms like “brother,” revealing a male narrator, but it’s overshadowed by race as 
          the poem’s core concern. The poet, being a Black man, channels his intersectionality primarily 
          through the lens of racial identity. Gender doesn’t dominate the poem, likely because 
          discrimination based on race was more pressing in his context.
        </td>
        <td>
          Rita Joe’s poem reveals her Indigeneity more than her womanhood. Terms like “girl” or “she” 
          aren’t focal points; instead, the cultural clash and residential school experiences define her 
          intersectional lens. The poem is shaped by her identity as an Indigenous woman, but specifically, 
          the oppression of her culture takes center stage.

          Hughes doesn’t overtly say “resilience,” but it’s shown. He’s sent to eat in the kitchen, yet 
          he laughs, grows strong, and visualizes a day when he’ll be accepted at the table. That quiet 
          confidence is the poem’s core statement on resilience.
        </td>
        <td>
          Joe also doesn’t say “resilience” outright, but we see it in her gentle refusal to hate, and in 
          her yearning to reclaim her lost talk. Even though part of her identity was taken, she’s still 
          determined to reconnect with it—an act of profound resilience.
